# RAR 2.9 producer marker

The `rar29` writer emits the same `RARS` new-subblock as RAR 3/4: type `0x7a`,
flags `0xc000`, a 36-byte header, stored method `0x30`, unpacker version 29,
zero host/attributes/time, and the shared `rars/<version>\nmarker-schema=1\n`
payload. At version 0.10.2 this adds 64 bytes to each archive or volume.

An old-style archive comment must immediately follow the main header. The
producer follows that comment, before members; without a comment it follows
the main header. The initial prototype put the producer before the comment:
member extraction passed, but RAR 3.93 reported a corrupt comment. That layout
was rejected. The final probe checks comment export explicitly, in addition to
file tests and extraction hashes.

Preserving rewrites recognize and replace the producer using the existing
bounded, CRC-checked schema validation. The marker requires at least `rar29`,
not `rar30`; a RAR 3 comment or encrypted headers still requires `rar30`.
Otherwise identical RAR 2.9/3/4 archives cannot reveal the original target
selection. Rewriting uses the lowest supported format implied by their records.
The subsequent [RAR 2.0 backfit](../rar20/README.md) uses unpacker version 20
for its producer; RAR 1.5 now uses unpacker version 15; see the
[RAR 1.5 report](../rar15/README.md). RAR 1.4 output remains unmarked.

## Evidence

**220 comparisons across 20 executable builds: 208 pass, 12 baseline failures,
zero marker regressions.** RAR and WinRAR 2.90 both pass all 11 cases. All 14
corruption controls pass. Independent framing checks cover 38 archive/volume
files. All four update checks pass: RAR 2.90 and 3.93 preserve the comment and
members, and discard the unknown producer record as requested by its flags.

`results.json` records paired control/marked runs against the pre-change writer
at `c3a382f`, reader and writer fingerprints, explicit comments, corruption
controls and reference updates. The native corpus includes a Unicode filename;
the Windows corpus uses its ASCII spelling, as in the RAR 3/4 investigation.
Every successful extraction requires exact filenames and content SHA256 hashes.

The 11 archive shapes are stored, compressed, solid, archive comment, stored and
compressed password protection, stored/compressed/solid/password volumes, and
an empty file. Header encryption is not supported by the `rar29` target.
Both the RAR 2.90 console and the actual WinRAR 2.90 GUI executable are tested
under Wine/Xvfb, alongside the established RAR 3/4 reader matrix.

The old 2.90 distribution's `TechNote.txt` documents the common `0x4000`
(discard unknown records on update) and `0x8000` (additional data size) flags,
although its declared block list stops at `0x79`. Thus the framing is skippable
without understanding the new subblock name. The local reference document is
fingerprinted in the evidence. Compatibility conclusions come from executable
tests, not from assuming a decoder's behavior based on its version label.

Baseline failures are retained, not treated as evidence of compatibility:
libarchive fails old-style comments, solid data, passwords and multivolume
extraction; The Unarchiver fails password cases. RAR 5.00 exports the comment
with its final character missing in both variants. UnRAR has no `cw` command,
so its comment check inspects the text displayed by `t` instead.

Negative controls flip a stored member byte and require CRC-error exit 3 from
RAR/WinRAR. Reference update checks require the old-style comment and all
member contents to survive adding a member. Raw framing checks validate header
CRCs, producer payload CRCs, exact framing and one producer in every volume.

Recovery generation is still unsupported for this writer. The unchanged
producer framing's recovery-protected behavior was tested in the
[RAR 3/4 investigation](../rar34/README.md); this report does not claim an
additional RAR 2.90 recovery-protection matrix. Likewise, Wine command-driven
GUI executable tests do not establish native Windows or manual GUI behavior.
The marker is advisory, removable and forgeable.

## Reproduce

Build `rars-cli` at `c3a382f` and retain that binary as the control. Build the
current source as the marked writer. Supply engine JSON lists as described in
the [parent report](../README.md), using the reader paths recorded in the
results. The scripts do not modify source or install software.

```sh
python3 scripts/producer-marker/rar29/probe.py --jobs 4 \
  --control /path/to/control --marked /path/to/marked \
  --engines /path/to/native.json --output target/rar29-native

xvfb-run -a python3 scripts/producer-marker/rar29/probe.py --ascii --jobs 6 \
  --control /path/to/control --marked /path/to/marked \
  --engines /path/to/windows.json --output target/rar29-windows

xvfb-run -a python3 scripts/producer-marker/rar29/maintenance.py \
  --matrix target/rar29-windows --engines /path/to/rar-update-engines.json \
  --output target/rar29-maintenance

xvfb-run -a python3 scripts/producer-marker/rar29/negative.py --jobs 5 \
  --matrix target/rar29-windows --engines /path/to/rar-winrar-engines.json \
  --output target/rar29-negative
```

Run the Wine invocations sequentially: sharing a Wine prefix across separate
concurrent Xvfb sessions can produce X display errors. Such infrastructure
failures must be rerun, not counted as reader baseline failures. `--resume`
resumes an interrupted main matrix with unchanged binaries and engine config.
Local archives and logs are under `target/producer-marker-rar29/`; the reference
WinRAR application directory was copied without modifying the user's prefix.

## Validation

The workspace/all-targets suite passes with external decoders required. The
final preserving-version adjustment and comment assertions also pass the focused
producer/rewrite tests. Clippy with warnings denied, formatting, minimal-write
marker tests and the reader-only build pass.
